# minishell2 ‚å®Ô∏è

Welcome to **minishell2**.

The continuation of your journey in Shell Programming.

This project, as a part of the B2 curriculum, aims to enhance your minishell1 project by introducing additional shell functionalities such as `semicolons`, `pipes`, and `redirections`.

## Language and Tools üõ†Ô∏è

![C](https://img.shields.io/badge/C-00599C?style=for-the-badge&logo=c&logoColor=white)

- **Language:** C
- **Compilation:** Via Makefile, including `re`, `clean`, and `fclean` rules.
- **Binary Name:** mysh

## Project Overview üîé

The goal of `minishell2` is to expand upon the basic shell programming skills acquired in `minishell1`.

This involves adding complex shell features like command separation with semicolons, command piping, and file redirections, bringing you one step closer to implementing a fully functional shell.

### Core Features

- **Command Separation:** Use of semicolons (`;`) to execute multiple commands sequentially.
- **Command Piping:** Implementation of pipes (`|`) to redirect the output of one command to another.
- **File Redirections:** Support for input (`<`), output (`>`), and append (`>>`) redirections.

### Usage Examples

```
‚àº> ./mysh
> ls -l; ls -l | wc -l
total 4
